# Mobile-Package-Program
This Python script allows users to select a subscription package from a predefined list (Monthly, Weekly, or Mini). The user can choose a package, confirm their choice, and the script will display a message based on their confirmation. If the user cancels, the subscription will be canceled. The script displays the price of the selected package and provides feedback about the subscription process.
